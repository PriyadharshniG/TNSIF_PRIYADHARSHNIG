# TNSIF_PRIYADHARSHNIG

This repository contains my Java programming practice and demonstrations, created as part of the **TNSIF training program**.  
It includes well-structured examples of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and other fundamental Java topics.

##  Topics Covered
- Encapsulation (getters, setters, data hiding)
- Abstraction (abstract classes, methods, runtime polymorphism)
- Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical)
- Polymorphism (method overloading and overriding)
- Basic Programs and Hands-on Exercises

##  Purpose
This repo is designed for:
- Learning and revising Java concepts
- Understanding OOP principles through simple examples
- Serving as a reference for assignments, projects, and interviews
